- Refactored metadata so all program pairs are successfully downloaded. There might be a slight problem where some C files contain multiple programs. For example, `pgrep.c` contains the `pidwait`, `pgrep`, and `pkill` programs.
- Refactored code that parses metadata files so that errors are handled gracefully instead of panicking.
- Completed chapters 9.2, 9.3, 10.1 of the textbook.
